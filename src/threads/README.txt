In the pintos/src/tests/threads folder, I created/modified a few different filesin order to accomodate the alarm-mega function within Pintos.  I first modified the tests.c file in order to create a struct that was similar to the others created within that file, aliased by the function names provided in the project writeup.  Then, I edited the header file for that tests.c file to include the test_alarm_mega test in order to define all references to this within the Makefile for the project.  I then edited the Rubric.alarm file to include a value of 4 to the alarm-mega function, which was the same value I saw for alarm-multiple, the function we were to base our alarm-mega function off of.  Finally, I created an alarm-mega.ck file in order to define the functionality even further, assigning it five threads with 70 iterations for each thread, making a total of 350 iterations between all five.  Lastly, the Make.tests file was edited in order to add a line including the alarm-mega function on the same line as where alarm-multiple lay.
